But the Dodgers manager claimed the San Diego Padres, their first playoff opponent, was their biggest challenge. [@cr-roberts]{zoom-to="1" highlight="1"}

Looking the the quality of balls in hit play during the series can give us a deeper insight on the Dodgers-Padres series. This plot was inspired by a [project made by Jim Albert](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2023/10/23/zack-wheelers-pitching-in-the-2023-nlcs/). [@cr-launchplot_full_static]

Ground balls tend to occur in this range, with lower launch angles. [@cr-launchplot_full_static]{pan-to="755px"}


Pop-ups tend to occur in this range, with higher launch angles. [@cr-launchplot_full_static]{pan-to="-825px"}


While line drives and fly balls fall somewhere in between. [@cr-launchplot_full_static]

Since the score difference between teams in most games was close, let's zoom into the area where home runs occurred. @cr-launchplot_hr_range

We can see that the 17 home runs hit in the series had a launch angle ranging from 22 to 37 degrees and a launch speed ranging from 94 to 112 miles per hour. However, other events, including outs and other hit types, occurred within the ranges of those metrics. @cr-launchplot_hr_range

Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, the 2024 National League Most Valuable Player award winner, hit 2 balls within the home range run window. @cr-launchplot_hr_range_Ohtani

His home run was a substantial key to the Dodgers win in Game 1, as it scored 3 runs in a game the Dodgers won 7-5. @cr-launchplot_hr_Ohtani_HR

Padres third baseman Manny Machado, hit 3 balls within the home range run window. @cr-launchplot_hr_range_Machado

If we expand the window of observations we see by increasing the launch angle from 37 degrees to 41 degrees, we can see a couple more near miss home runs from Machado. @cr-launchplot-MachadoNearMiss

Two of the balls *not* hit for a home run occurred in Game 5, where the Padres lost 2-0. Each of those balls came up just short of clearing the wall for a home run. @cr-launchplot-MachadoNearMissOnly
