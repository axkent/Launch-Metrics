Looking the the quality of balls in hit play during the series can give us a deeper insight on the Dodgers-Padres series. 
This plot was inspired by a [project made by Jim Albert](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2023/10/23/zack-wheelers-pitching-in-the-2023-nlcs/).  @cr-launchplot_full

Since the score difference between teams in most games was close, let's zoom into the area where home runs occurred.  @cr-launchplot_hr_range

We can see that the 17 home runs hit in the series had a launch angle ranging from 22 to 37 degrees and a launch speed ranging from 94 to 112 miles per hour. However, other events, including outs and other hit types, occurred within the ranges of those metrics. @cr-launchplot_hr_range
