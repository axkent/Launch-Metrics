The Los Angeles Dodgers won their 8th World Series title on October 28th, defeating the New York Yankees 4 games to 1 in a Best-of-7 Series. @cr-WS

But the Dodgers' manager called the San Diego Padres, their first playoff opponent, their toughest challenge. [@cr-roberts]{zoom-to="1" highlight="1"}

| “I felt, from my perspective, that was the World Series...
| when we started the postseason, they were one through 26, the best team..."

The Dodgers won the NLDS 3-2 in a Best-of-5 series. Aside from Game 2 and Game 4, all games were decided by 3 runs or fewer. @cr-NLDS

To deeper analyze the series, let's look at the quality of balls in play. This visualization is inspired by a [project by Jim Albert](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2023/10/23/zack-wheelers-pitching-in-the-2023-nlcs/). @cr-launchplot_full_static

-   Blue dots represent hits. 
-   Orange dots represent all other ball in play events.
-   **Large blue dots represent home runs.**

Ground balls typically occur in this range, with low launch angles. [@cr-launchplot_full_static]{pan-to="715px"}

Pop-ups typically occur in this range, with high launch angles. [@cr-launchplot_full_static]{pan-to="-825px"}

Line drives and fly balls fall somewhere in between. @cr-launchplot_full_static

Given the close score margins in most of the games, looking at the window of where home runs fell may be insightful. Let's zoom in on the area where home runs, and near-home runs occurred. @cr-launchplot_hr_range

The 17 home runs hit in the series had launch angles ranging from 22 to 37 degrees and launch speeds from 94 to 112 mph. As seen in the plot, a ball falling in the home run window does not necessarily mean a home run occurred. @cr-launchplot_hr_range

Two near-home runs came in Game 5, a 2-0 loss for the Padres. Both balls fell just short of clearing the wall for home runs, suggesting how subtle shifts in launch metrics can influence baseball history. @cr-launchplot-MachadoNearMissOnly

# Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge [Jim Albert](https://gist.github.com/bayesball), for his visualizations created on his blog post titled ["Zack Wheeler’s Pitching in the 2023 NLCS"](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2023/10/23/zack-wheelers-pitching-in-the-2023-nlcs/) encouraged me to do a deep dive on the 2024 Dodgers-Padres playoff series. Albert's code used to generate that blog post's visualizations is found [here](https://gist.github.com/bayesball/a1f8ddb4593e7b31b83022e511f5e560).

I would also like to acknowledge [Robert Frey](https://github.com/robert-frey), for his YouTube tutorial titled ["Combine Video with a Savant Dataset!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_fIJxuaQL8) and code demonstrated how to retrieve videos for each observation. Frey's code is available [here](https://github.com/robert-frey/YouTube/blob/master/Combine%20Video%20with%20a%20Savant%20Dataset!/savant_videos.R).
