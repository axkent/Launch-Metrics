# Closeread Project: Launch Angle Metrics in a Baseball Series

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axkent/MLB_LaunchAngle/refs/heads/main/visualizations/READMEdemo.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC3ULW5RJVVCAVA56IZBBIZEZ3JC54A)

## Overview
This repository contains materials for my [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/) project, an analysis of the 2024 Dodgers-Padres playoff matchup. The project includes:

- A Closeread article that explores the series' launch angle metrics, with a particular focus on home runs. The Closeread extension must be installed to reproduce the article locally.
- A Shiny app providing interactive visualizations and analysis of launch angle data. Most of the visualizations in the Closeread article were retrieved from the app. 
- Supporting data, a data retrieval script, and visualizations to build the article.

You can view the published Closeread article here:

The Shiny app is hosted here:

## How to Run the Shiny App

### Locally
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/axkent/MLB_LaunchAngle
   ```
2. Navigate to the `shiny` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Closeread-project/shiny
   ```
3. Open `app.R` in RStudio and click **Run App**.

### Online
You can access the Shiny app here:

## Data and Visualizations
- **Data**: The data used in the analysis is stored in the `shiny/` folder. You can regenerate the dataset using the `retrieve_data.R` script.
- **Visualizations**: The visualizations, including those created by the Shiny app and others used in the Closeread article, are in the `visualizations/` folder.

## Acknowledgments
This is my project for submission to the [Closeread Prize](https://posit.co/blog/Closeread-prize-announcement/). Big thank you to the Posit community for their help and putting this together.

I would like to acknowledge [Jim Albert](https://gist.github.com/bayesball), for his visualizations created on his blog post titled ["Zack Wheelerâ€™s Pitching in the 2023 NLCS"](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2023/10/23/zack-wheelers-pitching-in-the-2023-nlcs/) encouraged me to do a deep dive on the 2024 Dodgers-Padres playoff series. Albert's code used to generate that blog post's visualizations is found [here](https://gist.github.com/bayesball/a1f8ddb4593e7b31b83022e511f5e560).

I would also like to acknowledge [Robert Frey](https://github.com/robert-frey), for his YouTube tutorial titled ["Combine Video with a Savant Dataset!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_fIJxuaQL8) and code demonstrated how to retrieve videos for each observation. Frey's code is available [here](https://github.com/robert-frey/YouTube/blob/master/Combine%20Video%20with%20a%20Savant%20Dataset!/savant_videos.R).
